    shortDescription: 'Very weak, mostly-random play for learning the rules.',
    detailedDescription:
      'Uses a mostly random policy with only light safeguards against illegal or impossible moves. Intended purely for learning the interface and basic rules, not for meaningful competition.',
    recommendedAudience:
      'First-time strategy players and testers who want a stress-free way to learn RingRift basics.',
    notes: 'Baseline-only tier; not part of the human-calibrated ladder.',

    name: 'Learner (D2 – Casual / Learning)',
    shortDescription:
      'Gentle heuristic AI that plays legal, coherent moves but misses many tactics.',
    detailedDescription:
      'Backed by the square8 2-player heuristic profile used for the canonical D2 ladder tier. Makes legal, coherent moves and pursues simple goals but still overlooks many short tactics and long-term plans. New players should be able to win some games after a brief warm-up.',
    recommendedAudience:
      'Brand-new RingRift players and casual board-gamers who want a forgiving opponent while they internalise the rules.',

    shortDescription:
      'Entry-level minimax that sees short tactics but still leaves chances to outplay it.',
    detailedDescription:
      'Backed by the canonical D3 minimax profile (heuristic evaluation only). Sees short tactical sequences and avoids many one-move blunders, but remains beatable through deeper planning, resource management, and complex multi-threat positions.',
    recommendedAudience:
      'Players who can reliably beat D2 and want a slightly tougher but still relaxed experience.',
    notes:
      'Canonical ladder tier: minimax (non-neural). Search budget and randomness are tuned per board/profile.',

    shortDescription:
      'Minimax with NNUE evaluation that punishes obvious mistakes and wins many close games.',
    detailedDescription:
      'Backed by the canonical D4 minimax profile (NNUE evaluation). Sees short tactics, avoids most outright blunders, and reliably converts clear material or territory advantages. Stronger casual players should find this engaging but still winnable.',
    recommendedAudience:
      'Intermediate RingRift players and experienced abstract-board-game players (e.g. club-night Chess or Go strength).',

      'Backed by the canonical D7 MCTS profile (heuristic-only, no neural guidance). Plays with high tactical awareness and strong conversion, and will quickly capitalise on poor trades or slow play.',

    detailedDescription:
      'Backed by the canonical D8 MCTS profile (neural guidance with large search budget). Rarely blunders outright, converts small advantages, and punishes greedy territory or elimination attempts. Even very strong human players should find sustaining a high win rate difficult.',

      'Very strong RingRift players and serious abstract-game enthusiasts who want a near‑expert challenge.',
