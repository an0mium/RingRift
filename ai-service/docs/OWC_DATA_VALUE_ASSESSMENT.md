# OWC Drive Data Value Assessment (Archived)

This assessment is a Dec 2025 snapshot and has been archived for reference.
The canonical data pipeline has since tightened parity/history gates, so do
not treat this as current training guidance.

Current guidance:

- Canonical data must pass parity + canonical history validation.
- See `../TRAINING_DATA_REGISTRY.md`.
- See `specs/GAME_REPLAY_DATABASE_SPEC.md`.
