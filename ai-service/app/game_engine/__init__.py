"""Game engine package for RingRift.

This package contains the core game engine that implements RingRift rules.
The canonical rules are defined in RULES_CANONICAL_SPEC.md.

Package structure:
- phase_requirements.py: Phase requirement types and data classes (SSoT)
- _game_engine_legacy.py: Original monolithic module (DEPRECATED - being migrated)

Public API re-exports from appropriate SSoT locations.

Migration Plan (December 2025):
    The GameEngine class is being migrated from the legacy module to a canonical
    implementation. During the migration period:

    1. **Canonical imports**: Use ``from app.game_engine import GameEngine``
       This is the stable public API that will continue to work.

    2. **Direct legacy imports**: ``from app._game_engine_legacy import ...``
       This is DEPRECATED and will emit warnings. Migrate to canonical imports.

    3. **Legacy replay functions**: Use ``app.rules.legacy`` for replaying
       pre-canonical game recordings. These violate RR-CANON-R075.

Target Removal Date: Q2 2026
