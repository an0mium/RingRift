PositionalEvaluator: Positional evaluation for HeuristicAI.

This module provides the PositionalEvaluator class which handles all
positional evaluation features:
- Territory control (current territory space advantage)
- Center control (stacks in center positions)
- Territory closure (marker clustering for enclosure)
- Territory safety (distance from opponent stacks)

Extracted from HeuristicAI as part of the decomposition plan
(docs/architecture/HEURISTIC_AI_DECOMPOSITION_PLAN.md).

Example usage:
    evaluator = PositionalEvaluator()
    score = evaluator.evaluate_positional(game_state, player_idx=1)
    
    # Get detailed breakdown
    breakdown = evaluator.get_breakdown(game_state, player_idx=1)
    print(breakdown)  # {'territory': 16.0, 'center_control': 8.0, ...}
