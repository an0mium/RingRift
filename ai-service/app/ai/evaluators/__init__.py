"""
Feature evaluators for HeuristicAI decomposition.

This package contains specialized evaluator classes that implement focused
subsets of the evaluation logic previously contained in the monolithic
HeuristicAI class. Each evaluator focuses on a specific domain of game
state evaluation.

Available Evaluators:
- MaterialEvaluator: Ring counts, stack heights, material balance
- PositionalEvaluator: Territory control, center positions, connectivity
- TacticalEvaluator: Captures, threats, vulnerability
- MobilityEvaluator: Movement options, pseudo-mobility, stack mobility
- StrategicEvaluator: Victory proximity, forced elimination risk, LPS
- EndgameEvaluator: Terminal detection, game phase, recovery potential

Future Evaluators (planned):
- LineStructureEvaluator: Line potential, marker connectivity
