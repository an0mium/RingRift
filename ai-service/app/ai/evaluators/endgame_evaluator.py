"""
EndgameEvaluator: Endgame and terminal position evaluation for HeuristicAI.

This module provides the EndgameEvaluator class which handles all
endgame-related evaluation features:
- Terminal position detection
- Game phase detection (early/mid/late/endgame)
- Recovery potential evaluation (RR-CANON-R110-R115)
- Forced outcome detection

Extracted from HeuristicAI as part of the decomposition plan
(docs/architecture/HEURISTIC_AI_DECOMPOSITION_PLAN.md).

Example usage:
    evaluator = EndgameEvaluator()
    
    # Check if position is terminal
    is_terminal = evaluator.is_terminal_position(game_state)
    
    # Detect game phase
    phase = evaluator.get_game_phase(game_state)  # early/mid/late/endgame
    
    # Evaluate recovery potential
    score = evaluator.evaluate_recovery_potential(game_state, player_idx=1)
