"""Feedback loop controller mixins package.

January 2026 Sprint 17.9: Phase 4 decomposition of feedback_loop_controller.py.

This package contains mixin classes that extract focused functionality from
the main FeedbackLoopController (4,200 LOC) into smaller, testable modules.

Mixins:
- FeedbackClusterHealthMixin: Cluster health and capacity event handlers
- ExplorationBoostMixin: Exploration boost logic (anomaly, stall, decay)
- QualityFeedbackMixin: Quality assessment and quality -> intensity/curriculum feedback
- EloVelocityAdaptationMixin: Elo velocity tracking and adaptive training signals
- TrainingCurriculumFeedbackMixin: Training -> curriculum feedback and Elo recording
- LossMonitoringMixin: Loss anomaly detection and trend monitoring
- EvaluationFeedbackMixin: Evaluation triggering, gauntlet handling, retry logic
