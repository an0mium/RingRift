"""
Lightweight initial state creation for self-play and tournament matches.

This module is intentionally kept free of torch dependencies so it can be
imported without loading neural network libraries. Use this module when
you only need to create game states, not for full training data generation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    board_type:
        Board geometry to use (square8, square19, hexagonal).
    num_players:
        Number of active players in the game (2–4 supported).
    rings_per_player_override:
        Optional override for rings per player (for ablation experiments).
        If None, uses the default from BOARD_CONFIGS.
    lps_rounds_required:
        Number of consecutive exclusive rounds required for LPS victory.
        Default is 3 for training (stricter than the historical 2-round rule).
