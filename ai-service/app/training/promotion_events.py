"""Event definitions and emitters for automated model promotion.

This module provides event types and helper functions for emitting
promotion-related events that integrate with the feedback loop system.

Events emitted:
- MODEL_AUTO_PROMOTED: Model passed evaluation and was promoted
- MODEL_PROMOTION_REJECTED: Model failed evaluation criteria
- MODEL_PROMOTION_DEFERRED: Evaluation deferred (e.g., insufficient data)

Usage:
    from app.training.promotion_events import (
        PromotionEventType,
        emit_promotion_event,
    )

    emit_promotion_event(
        event_type=PromotionEventType.MODEL_AUTO_PROMOTED,
        model_path="models/hex8_2p_epoch50.pth",
        board_type="hex8",
        num_players=2,
        reason="Elo parity achieved: 1450 >= 1400",
    )
