"""P2P Orchestration module for distributed AI training cluster.

This module provides modular components for the P2P orchestrator:
- Configuration and constants
- Node and job management data structures
- Training coordination utilities
- Data synchronization helpers
- Webhook/notification services

The full P2P orchestrator (scripts/p2p_orchestrator.py) is being incrementally
modularized. New code should import from this module where possible.

Usage:
    from app.p2p import (
        P2PConfig,
        NodeRole,
        JobType,
        NodeInfo,
        TrainingThresholds,
    )

    # Check if a node can accept new jobs
    config = P2PConfig()
    if node.load_score < config.LOAD_MAX_FOR_NEW_JOBS:
        # Schedule job
        pass
