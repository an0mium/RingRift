# Training Targets Configuration
# December 2025: Defines Elo targets and training parameters for each board configuration
#
# Usage:
#   from app.config.training_targets import get_training_targets, is_target_reached
#
#   targets = get_training_targets("hex8_2p")
#   if is_target_reached("hex8_2p", current_elo=1650):
#       print("Target reached, stop selfplay")

# Global defaults (can be overridden per-config)
# Dec 28, 2025: Raised targets to 2000+ and lowered min_games for faster iteration
defaults:
  # Elo targets - RAISED to 2000+ for all configs
  elo_target: 2000 # Target Elo rating (was 1800)
  elo_tolerance: 50 # Consider target reached if within this range

  # Selfplay parameters - LOWERED for faster iteration
  min_games_for_training: 100 # Dec 28: Lowered from 1000 for faster training
  max_games_per_day: 50000 # Cap daily selfplay to prevent runaway

  # Training parameters
  training_epochs: 50 # Default epochs per training run
  early_stopping_patience: 25 # Stop if no improvement for N epochs (was 10, too aggressive)

  # Evaluation parameters
  gauntlet_games: 50 # Games per opponent in gauntlet
  promotion_threshold_random: 0.85 # Must beat RANDOM 85%+
  promotion_threshold_heuristic: 0.60 # Must beat HEURISTIC 60%+

# Per-configuration targets
# Smaller boards have lower ceilings, larger boards have higher potential
configs:
  # Hex8 (61 cells) - Smallest board, fastest iteration
  # Dec 28, 2025: All targets raised to 2000+, min_games lowered
