"""
Tests for LPS and ring cap alignment in AI training code.

These tests verify that:
1. LPS (Last Player Standing - R172) terminations give appropriate rewards.
2. Own-colour ring caps (CLAR-003) are correctly handled in state encoding.
3. Victory reason inference works correctly for tournament statistics.
