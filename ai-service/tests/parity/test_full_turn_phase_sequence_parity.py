"""
Full turn phase sequence parity tests for Python engine.

These tests verify that multi-phase turn sequences correctly transition
through phases according to RR-CANON-R070 (Turn Phase Order):
1. Ring placement
2. Movement
3. Capture/chain capture
4. Line processing
5. Territory processing
6. Forced elimination (if blocked)

The Python engine must match TypeScript phase transition behavior for
training data parity.
