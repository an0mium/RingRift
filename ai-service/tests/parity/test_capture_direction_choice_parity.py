"""
Capture direction choice parity tests for Python engine.

These tests ensure that when multiple capture directions are available
(after an initial capture or chain continuation), the Python engine
correctly enumerates all valid capture options.

Per RR-CANON-R093 and RR-CANON-R100-R103:
- After non-capture movement landing on an opponent's stack, capture is mandatory
- Chain captures continue from landing position until no captures available
- When multiple capture directions exist, player must choose

These tests verify the Python AI service would receive correct capture options
for the CaptureDirectionChoice endpoint.
