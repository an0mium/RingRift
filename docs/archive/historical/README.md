# Historical Documentation Archive

This folder contains dated documentation that has been superseded or represents point-in-time snapshots.

## Contents

These documents are preserved for historical reference but are no longer actively maintained:

- Date-specific action plans and reviews
- Point-in-time state assessments
- Completed improvement plans
- Historical fix logs

## Note

Some snapshots preserve raw merge history and may include unresolved conflict markers.
For current documentation, see the parent directories or the [Documentation Index](../../../DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md).
